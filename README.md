This is Chen Su's Experiment Report of Fundamental Physics Experiments in Autumn 2023.
Firstly, I hate this course - these experiments are mostly a waste of time.
So I think it is necessary to post my results here, to help the latent victims overcome the barriers.
I have put all my reports here (in .docx format), along with some necessery documents and pictures.
The files are all written in Chinese. My files can only serve as references, and plagiarization is unacceptable.
